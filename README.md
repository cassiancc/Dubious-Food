## About

Minecraft user! Do you enjoy eating food? Yes? Wrong! Try **Dubious Food**, the new way to not enjoy food like ~~never~~ one time before! With Dubious Food, you no longer care for the appearence of food, giving it such colourful names as "Birdbits", "Mostly Seeds", and of course "It's Not A Pie, You Didn't Even Bake It"

A full list can be found in the [Gallery](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/dubious-food/gallery).

## Credits
This resource pack is a port of the names present from the [Food Restrictions](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_23w13a_or_b#All_food_restrictions) present in the 23w13a_or_b April Fools update. All names present were originally come up with by Mojang for this snapshot.
